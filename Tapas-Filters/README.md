# [Tapas Comic Filters](https://github.com/Efreak/UserScripts/raw/master/Tapas-Filters/TapasFilters.user.js)

## Description

This userscript is for filtering the tapas comic listing. I was (at the time) using another userscript that I no longer have to extract data from Tapas.

- Click on a genre in a tapas page listing to hide all results of that genre.
- Click on a comic name to hide just that comic.
