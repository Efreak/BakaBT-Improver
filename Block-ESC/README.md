# ESC Blocker/Interceptor

## [Install](https://github.com/Efreak/UserScripts/raw/master/Block-ESC/BlockEsc.user.js)
This userscript is intended to intercept ESC keypresses before a website is allowed to, and block the page from processing it. It was originally intended for Squarespace websites/forums, where hitting esc (ie, to close a popup), but other websites exist as well. If you'd like to whitelist a website, feel free to submit a *pull request* adding logic to ignore that site.
