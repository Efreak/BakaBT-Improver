# Userscripts

This is a copy of bookerly fonts (from skotzo/oldblog) for use in reading mode on websites. I mostly use it in combination with ublock origin and xstyles to turn websites into reading-mode (since firefox reader mode doesn't allow custom fonts, and doesn't include the next/prev fonts). I am not including any actual usage here, merely the fonts themselves and a font-face cass file.

# Licenses

Wherever possible, the license is as broad as possible. I like WTFPL for my stuff. Obviously this doesn't apply to anything written by others (eg. BakaBT-Improver) or to the fonts themselves. If you're a font owner and want these removed, please let me know and I'll remove your fonts immediately (currently the only fonts not freely available are Amazon's fonts; if Amazon seemed interested in removing access to these fonts for personal usage, I would not have placed them in a public repo).
